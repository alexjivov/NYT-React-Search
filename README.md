# New York Times Search - React Version

This is a React.js app that allows users to search for New York Times articles. After performing a search, the user will see article results including the name of the article, the date and time of publishing, and a button linking to the article source. 

Users are also able to add and remove articles from a saved articles section. The app uses Node/Express for the server and routing, MongoDB/Mongoose for the database and models, Handlebars for the layout and views, & Cheerio/Request for scraping the data from www.npr.org
